# HookerAppliance
To Organize Appliance Stock for the Hooker Appliance Store

At the job I use to work at, they have hand written cards to keep track of the appliances that come into the store.
I have decided to make a program that can keep track of the appliances digitally.

Using the framework django in this project. 

to have a temporary server and database for the website, run this code in the comandline.
Be in the dirctory with manage.py to run these commands

$python manage.py makemigrations

$python manage.py migrate

$python manage.py runserver

You will be able to access the site at http://localhost:8000

To fill in the database run  http://localhost:8000/init
