# HookerAppliance
To Organize Appliance Stock for the Hooker Appliance Store

At the job I currently work at, they have hand written cards to keep track of the appliances that come into the store.
Knowing some programming I have decided to make a program that can keep track of the appliances digitally. I am not sure 
the best design for this project, but I am going to make a website that will use a database to keep all the appliances 
stored in data.

Using the framework django in this project. 

to have a temporary server and database for the website run this code in the comandline.
Be in the dirctory with manage.py to run these commands

$python manage.py makemigrations

$python manage.py migrate

$python manage.py runserver

You will be able to access the site at http://localhost:8000
